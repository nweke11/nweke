<font size="5" color="white" face="arial"</font>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Nweke Emeka, am from Anambra state but I base in Lagos state, I am dark in completion short in height. When I was small I graduated from a school that I did not know the name about, so I graduated from that school and I wanted to enter a primary school, but I was unable to enter the school, in all because of they was insufficient fund in the bank, so my parent struggle so hard for me just to go to that primary school, because of the struggle it took me 1 year, which means I use 1 year at home without going to school, so when the year has completed I now went to Aleen nursery and primary school and I was the best little kid student because I was a very serious minded kid then when I was in primary 1 from primary 1 I got double promotion to primary 3 because of my seriousness most teachers in the school like me more than they like them self so as I was promoted, I was so very happy of myself.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that was my first achievement of life and my parent  was so happy for me, so I continue my schooling still I got to basic 5, but then when I was in primary school, I was a playful kid, I normally make a lot of noise in the class but still I was always serious of my studies in the class, so when I was in basic 5 my dad choose and decided that I will have to write common entrance too jss1, but then I wasn’t ready that will be very tough examination because I was very scared and have been hearing many of my collogue saying that the exam was a little bit hard, but my dad sit me down and tell me that this is my first examination and it should also be my last, and him began to teach me most of those thing I need to kwon if I want to write the papers still it letter got to the day that I will have to write the examination, and I wrote it and I pass at once without going back and I even pass with a scholarship to go and study in any secondary of my choice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so  very happy of myself and my parent was so happy for me, and because of the passage in to a secondary school, my dad took me to a very biggest occasion in were I went to go and enjoy myself, so my dad told me that why he was doing all this things is because he want me to be more and more serious of my study and if I continue been serious he will continue taken me a place that I have seen before and the one bigger than the one I have never gone before,</p>
